## SDK Change Log

The change log for the SDK can be found in the [SDK.CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/blob/master/SDK.CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Looking for Version 2?

In anticipation of the GA release for version 3 we have merged it to master. We did this before GA to signify that version 3 is ready for production use and to help us with some of the final release and build automation tasks we are working on.

To find the current version 2 source checkout the [version 2 branch][github-aws-sdk-net-v2].

## Modularization

With version 3 of the AWS SDK for .NET the SDK has been modularized. This means a separate NuGet package is created for each service as well as a core project. To use this branch compile the solution in the **sdk** folder that matches the desired platform and then include the assemblies for the services needed as well as the core assembly.

## Portable Class Library

This release of the AWS SDK for .NET adds support for Portable Class Library projects, which allow you to target multiple platforms including Windows Store, Windows Phone, and Xamarin on iOS and Android. More information on this can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/index.html).

## Unity Support

This release of AWS SDK for .NET adds support for generating Assemblies for Unity. More information can be found [here](Unity.README.md)

### Silverlight support

Due to Silverlight HTTP Caching, AWS SDK for .NET is not fully supported on Silverlight-based platforms such as Windows Phone 8.0. Some HTTP GET calls (such as S3's ListBuckets or ListObjects) will return the same results when called multiple times.

## Tests

**Important:** Do not run the integration tests on a production account.

Integration tests can be found in the **AWSSDK.IntegrationTests** project. These test assume that a default profile has been 
configured for credentials. For information about setting up a default profile read the [Developer Guide][credentials-management].

The tests are designed to create and delete the resources needed for testing but it is important to keep your data safe. Do not run
these tests on accounts that contain production data or resources. Since AWS resources are created and deleted during the running 
of these tests, charges can occur. To reduce charges occurred by running the tests the test focus on AWS resources that have minimal cost.

Unit tests can be found in the **AWSSDK.UnitTests** project.
