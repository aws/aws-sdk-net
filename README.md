## Features

* Provides easy-to-use HTTP clients for all supported AWS services, regions, and authentication protocols.
* Amazon DynamoDB Object Persistence Framework - Uses Plain Old C# Objects (POCOs) to store and retrieve Amazon DynamoDB data.
* Amazon S3 Transfer Utility - With a simple API, achieves enhanced throughput, performance, and reliability by using multi-threaded Amazon S3 multi-part calls.
* Amazon Glacier ArchiveTransferManager - Eases transferring data to and from Amazon Glacier by automatically dividing large files into parts and by computing check sums.
* Amazon DynamoDB Session State Provider - Removes the session state scaling bottleneck by easily storing ASP.NET [session state in DynamoDB][Session-state].
* Automatically uses [IAM Instance Profile Credentials][aws-iam-credentials] on configured Amazon EC2 instances.
* And more!
