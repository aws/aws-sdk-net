### Opening Issues

If you encounter a bug with AWS SDK for .NET we would like to hear about it. Search the existing [issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist before opening a new issue. It’s helpful if you include the version of AWS SDK .NET and the OS you’re using. Please include a stack trace and reduced repro case when appropriate, too.

For help and questions with using AWS SDK for .NET please make use of the resources listed in the Getting Help section. There are limited resources available for handling issues and by keeping the list of open issues clean we can respond in a timely manner.

## SDK Change Log

The change log for the SDK can be found in the [SDK.CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/blob/master/SDK.CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Maintenance and support for SDK major versions

For information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the following in the AWS SDKs and Tools Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide:

* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html)
* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html)

## Looking for Version 2?

In anticipation of the GA release for version 3 we have merged it to master. We did this before GA to signify that version 3 is ready for production use and to help us with some of the final release and build automation tasks we are working on.

To find the current version 2 source checkout the [version 2 branch][github-aws-sdk-net-v2].

## Modularization

With version 3 of the AWS SDK for .NET the SDK has been modularized. This means a separate NuGet package is created for each service as well as a core project. To use this branch compile the solution in the **sdk** folder that matches the desired platform and then include the assemblies for the services needed as well as the core assembly.

## Versioning

The AWS SDK for .NET uses a 4 part versioning scheme following the pattern of `w.x.y.z`. 

* **w** - Incremented for code breaking changes.
* **x** - Incremented for binary breaking changes. In particular this is used to identitfy what versions of AWSSDK.Core are binary compatible with the service packages. For example if AWSSDK.SQS version 3.3.1.0 came out today when the current version of AWSSDK.Core is 3.3.17.5 then AWSSDK.SQS 3.3.1.0 would be compatible with all versions of AWSSDK.Core starting from 3.3.17.5 up to but not including a future 3.4.0.0.
* **y** - Incremented for a new SDK feature, like new credential management, or an AWS service update.
* **z** - Incremented for a bug fix or for service packages to update to the latest AWSSDK.Core to pull in latest bug fixes.

The SDK assemblies are strongly named which requires consumers of the SDK to recompile every time the `AssemblyVersion` attribute is incremented. To avoid forced recompilations the `AssemblyVersion` only contains the `w.x` portion of the version. The full `w.x.y.z` version number is set in the `AssemblyFileVersion` attribute which is not part of the strong name.

## Portable Class Library

This release of the AWS SDK for .NET adds support for Portable Class Library projects, which allow you to target multiple platforms including Windows Store, Windows Phone, and Xamarin on iOS and Android. More information on this can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/index.html).

## Unity Support

Starting with version 3.5 of the AWS SDK for .NET, projects using Unity 2018.1 or later should target the .NET Standard 2.0 release of the SDK. You can find additional information in the developer guide: [Unity support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/unity-special.html) and [Migrating your Unity application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/net-dg-v35.html#net-dg-v35-changes-unity).

You can find the archive for _**legacy**_ Unity support at https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-unity-net.

### Silverlight support

Due to Silverlight HTTP Caching, AWS SDK for .NET is not fully supported on Silverlight-based platforms such as Windows Phone 8.0. Some HTTP GET calls (such as S3's ListBuckets or ListObjects) will return the same results when called multiple times.

## Tests

**Important:** Do not run the integration tests on a production account.

Integration tests can be found in the **AWSSDK.IntegrationTests** project. These test assume that a default profile has been 
configured for credentials. For information about setting up a default profile read the [Developer Guide][credentials-management].

The tests are designed to create and delete the resources needed for testing but it is important to keep your data safe. Do not run
these tests on accounts that contain production data or resources. Since AWS resources are created and deleted during the running 
of these tests, charges can occur. To reduce charges occurred by running the tests the test focus on AWS resources that have minimal cost.

Unit tests can be found in the **AWSSDK.UnitTests** project.
