    /// such as hardware failures and network connectivity problems. This call reports such problems as impaired reachability.</para> </li>

    /// problems as impaired reachability.</para> </li>
    /// 
    /// </ul>
    /// <para>Instance status provides information about four types of scheduled events for an instance that may require your attention:</para>
    /// <ul>
    /// <li> <para>Scheduled Reboot: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must be rebooted, the instances status returns one of two event
    /// codes: <c>system-reboot</c> or <c>instance-reboot</c> . System reboot commonly occurs if certain maintenance or upgrade operations require a
    /// reboot of the underlying host that supports an instance. Instance reboot commonly occurs if the instance must be rebooted, rather than the
    /// underlying host. Rebooting events include a scheduled start and end time.</para> </li>
    /// <li> <para>System Maintenance: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance requires maintenance that requires power or network impact, the
    /// instance status is the event code <c>system-maintenance</c> . System maintenance is either power maintenance or network maintenance. For
    /// power maintenance, your instance will be unavailable for a brief period of time and then rebooted. For network maintenance, your instance
    /// will experience a brief loss of network connectivity. System maintenance events include a scheduled start and end time. You will also be
    /// notified by email if one of your instances is set for system maintenance. The email message indicates when your instance is scheduled for
    /// maintenance.</para> </li>
    /// <li> <para>Scheduled Retirement: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must be shut down, the instance status is the event code
    /// <c>instance-retirement</c> . Retirement commonly occurs when the underlying host is degraded and must be replaced. Retirement events include
    /// a scheduled start and end time. You will also be notified by email if one of your instances is set to retiring. The email message indicates
    /// when your instance will be permanently retired.</para> </li>
    /// <li> <para>Scheduled Stop: When Amazon EC2 determines that an instance must be shut down, the instances status returns an event code called
    /// <c>instance-stop</c> .
    /// Stop events include a scheduled start and end time. You will also be notified by email if one of your instances is set to stop. The
    /// email message indicates when your instance will be stopped.</para> </li>
    /// 
    /// </ul>
    /// <para>When your instance is retired, it will either be terminated (if its root device type is the instance-store) or stopped (if its root
    /// device type is an EBS volume). Instances stopped due to retirement will not be restarted, but you can do so manually. You can also avoid
    /// retirement of EBS-backed instances by manually restarting your instance when its event code is <c>instance-retirement</c> . This ensures
