# AI Memory Bank

You are an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: your knowledge about this project relies on the project Memory Bank. To understand the project and continue work effectively, you MUST read ALL files in the @memory-bank folder. This is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectBrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectBrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context Partitions
Partitions contain additional files/folders within memory-bank/partitions/ to help organize additional information that is not core memory-bank information:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

Each partition starts with a `partitionBrief.md` file to help determine if the full partition is needed:

    Relevant -->|Yes| Full[Read Full Partition]
    Relevant -->|No| Skip[Skip Partition]
    Full --> Apply[Apply Knowledge]
    Skip --> Next[Next Partition]

1. `dualsupport/partitionBrief.md` → `dualsupport/dualSupport.md`
   - GitHub branch structure for V3/V4 support
   - Issue and PR management across versions
   - Branch naming conventions
   - Build system considerations
   - Developer guidelines for dual version support

2. `v3v4-upgrade/partitionBrief.md` → `v3v4-upgrade/upgradeGuide.md`, `breakingChanges.md`
   - Step-by-step V3 to V4 migration process
   - Package update procedures
   - Collection and nullable type handling
   - Migration strategies and testing
   - Comprehensive breaking changes catalog
   - Before/after code examples for each change

3. `sdkdeveloper/partitionBrief.md` → `sdkdeveloper/codeStructure.md`, `buildSystem.md`, `devConfig.md`
   - Advanced guidance for SDK source code contributions
   - Repository organization and project structure
   - Code generation patterns and service models
   - Build system processes and testing frameworks
   - Internal architecture and development patterns
   - DevConfig file creation and version management

4. `sdkhelper/partitionBrief.md` → `sdkhelper/credentialsAuth.md`, `usagePatterns.md`
   - Advanced SDK usage patterns for customer applications
   - Credential management and authentication strategies
   - Service client configuration and best practices
   - Error handling, retry logic, and performance optimization
   - Testing patterns and async/await implementations

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
