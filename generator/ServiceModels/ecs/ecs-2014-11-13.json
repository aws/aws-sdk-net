  "documentation": "\n        <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes\n            it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your\n            cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your\n            services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your\n            tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2\n            launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html\">Amazon ECS Launch Types</a>.</p>\n        <p>Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls,\n            allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you\n            access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p>\n        <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on\n            your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates\n            the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management\n            systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>\n      ",

The <code>host</code> and\n                <code>awsvpc</code> network modes offer the highest networking performance for\n            containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network\n            stack provided by the <code>bridge</code> mode.</p>\n        <p>With the <code>host</code> and <code>awsvpc</code> network modes, exposed container\n            ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the <code>host</code>\n            network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the\n                <code>awsvpc</code> network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port\n            mappings. </p>\n        <p>If the network mode is <code>awsvpc</code>, the task is allocated an elastic network\n            interface, and you must specify a <a>NetworkConfiguration</a> when you create\n            a service or run a task with the task definition.

If the <code>host</code> parameter is empty, then the Docker\n            daemon assigns a host path for your data volume, but the data is not guaranteed to\n            persist after the containers associated with it stop running.</p>\n        <p>Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as\n                <code>$env:ProgramData</code>. Windows containers cannot mount directories on a\n            different drive, and mount point cannot be across drives. For example, you can mount\n                <code>C:\\my\\path:C:\\my\\path</code> and <code>D:\\:D:\\</code>, but not\n                <code>D:\\my\\path:C:\\my\\path</code> or <code>D:\\:C:\\my\\path</code>.</p>\n      ",

The minimum valid CPU share value\n            that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you\n            can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2\n            (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent\n            version:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:</b>\n                    Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts\n                    to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux\n                    kernel converts to 2 CPU shares.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>\n                    <b>Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:</b>\n                    Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a\n            quota.

If you are using the\n            Fargate launch type, the <code>awsvpc</code> network mode is required. If\n            you are using the EC2 launch type, any network mode can be used. If the\n            network mode is set to <code>none</code>, you can't specify port mappings in your\n            container definitions, and the task's containers do not have external connectivity. The\n                <code>host</code> and <code>awsvpc</code> network modes offer the highest networking\n            performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the\n            virtualized network stack provided by the <code>bridge</code> mode.</p>\n        <p>With the <code>host</code> and <code>awsvpc</code> network modes, exposed container\n            ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the <code>host</code>\n            network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the\n                <code>awsvpc</code> network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port\n            mappings. </p>\n        <p>If the network mode is <code>awsvpc</code>, the task is allocated an elastic network\n            interface, and you must specify a <a>NetworkConfiguration</a> when you create\n            a service or run a task with the task definition.

If the\n            number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns\n            another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see\n                <a>UpdateService</a>.</p>\n        <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can\n            optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes\n            traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see\n                <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the\n                <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n        <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a\n            deployment, the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and\n                <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy. The\n            deployment is triggered by changing the task definition or the desired count of a\n            service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation.</p>\n        <p>The <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> represents a lower limit on the number of your\n            service's tasks that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment,\n            as a percentage of the <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded up to the nearest integer).\n            This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For\n            example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a\n                <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50%, the scheduler can stop two existing tasks\n            to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that\n                <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are\n            in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a\n            load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and\n            the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.\n            The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in\n            the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs. The default value for\n            a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0% for the AWS CLI, the AWS\n            SDKs, and the APIs and 50% for the console.</p>\n        <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of\n            your service's tasks that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or\n                <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the\n                <code>desiredCount</code> (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter\n            enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your replica service\n            has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks and a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of\n            200%, the scheduler can start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks\n            (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default\n            value for a replica service for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%. If you are using a\n            daemon service type, the <code>maximumPercent</code> should remain at 100%, which is the\n            default value.</p>\n        <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your\n            cluster using the following logic:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your\n                    service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory,\n                    ports, and container instance attributes).</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across\n                    Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement\n                    strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                        <p>Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that\n                            have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their\n                            respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running\n                            service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances\n                            in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p>\n                    </li>\n                  <li>\n                        <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal\n                            Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container\n                            instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this\n                            service.</p>\n                    </li>\n               </ul>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        \n      "

The service scheduler uses the\n            minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment\n            configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.</p>\n        <note>\n            <p>If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task\n                definition for your service (for example, <code>my_image:latest</code>), you do not\n                need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service\n                using the <code>forceNewDeployment</code> option. The new tasks launched by the\n                deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they\n                start.</p>\n        </note>\n        <p>You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is\n            triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the\n            deployment configuration parameters, <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and\n                <code>maximumPercent</code>, to determine the deployment strategy.</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>If <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore\n                        <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if\n                        <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the\n                    scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for\n                    services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in\n                    the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are\n                    considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the\n                    container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load\n                    balancer.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the\n                    number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the\n                    deployment batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks,\n                    a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks\n                    (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent\n            of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers running in the task. This\n            results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after which\n                <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the\n            container handles the <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from\n            receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.</p>\n        <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your\n            cluster with the following logic:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your\n                    service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory,\n                    ports, and container instance attributes).</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across\n                    Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement\n                    strategy):</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                        <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running\n                            tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance.\n                            For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C\n                            each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are\n                            considered optimal for placement.</p>\n                    </li>\n                  <li>\n                        <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal\n                            Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container\n                            instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this\n                            service.</p>\n                    </li>\n               </ul>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across\n            the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <p>Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this\n                    service in the same Availability Zone as the instance.
