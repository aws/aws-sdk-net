For more information about using this\n      service, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html\">AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</a>.</p>\n\n         <p>\n            <b>API Version</b>\n         </p>\n\n         <p>This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.</p>\n         <note>\n            <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which\n        consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (such\n        as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create\n        programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically\n        signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information\n        about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>\n         </note>\n         <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However,\n      you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To\n      learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html\">Making Query Requests</a> in the\n        <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. </p>\n         <p>Secrets Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API doesn't require you\n      to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the\n      limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST\n      request.</p>\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n         <p>\n            <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager</b>\n         </p>\n\n         <p>We welcome your feedback.

For more\n      information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see <a href=\"http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa\">Forums\n        Help</a>.</p>\n\n         <p>\n            <b>How examples are presented</b>\n         </p>\n\n         <p>The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and that the service returns as\n      a response to HTTP query requests are single, long strings without line breaks or white space\n      formatting. The JSON shown in the examples is formatted with both line breaks and white space\n      to improve readability. When example input parameters would also result in long strings that\n      extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always\n      submit the input as a single JSON text string.</p>\n\n\n         <p>\n            <b>Logging API Requests</b>\n         </p>\n         <p>AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS\n      account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected\n      by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who\n      made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and its support for\n      AWS CloudTrail, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging\n        AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail</a> in the <i>AWS Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.\n      To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the\n        <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>\n\n      ",
