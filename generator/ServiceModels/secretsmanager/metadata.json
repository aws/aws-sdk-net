Instead of embedding credentials into your source code, you can dynamically query Secrets Manager from your app whenever you need credentials. You can automatically and frequently rotate your secrets without having to deploy updates to your apps. All secret values are encrypted when they're at rest with AWS KMS, and while they're in transit with HTTPS and TLS.",
