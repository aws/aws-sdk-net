When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream.\n            You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. \n            For example, you can configure rules to:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for\n                    detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p>For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the \n            <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events\">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.</p>\n      ",

If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the\n            old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null\n            values.</p>\n        \n        <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start\n            matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take\n            effect.</p>\n        \n        <p>A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.</p>\n        \n        <p>Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). \n            However, CloudWatch Events uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the\n            correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN\n            syntax in the event you want to match.</p>\n        \n        <p>In CloudWatch Events, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule \n            is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and \n            trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent \n            change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p>\n        <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. \n            For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p>\n        <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, \n            which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

To invoke a command on\n            multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code>\n            field.</p>\n        <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch\n            Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources,\n            CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data\n            streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles\n            that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For\n            more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html\">Authentication\n                and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User\n                Guide</i>.</p>\n        <p>If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using\n                <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's\n            event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the\n            other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you\n            run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your\n            account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as\n            a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged.
