  "operations": {
    "AssignOpportunity": "<p> Enables you to reassign an existing <code>Opportunity</code> to another user within your Partner Central account. The specified user receives the opportunity, and it appears on their Partner Central dashboard, allowing them to take necessary actions or proceed with the opportunity. </p> <p> This is useful for distributing opportunities to the appropriate team members or departments within your organization, ensuring that each opportunity is handled by the right person. By default, the opportunity owner is the one who creates it. Currently, there's no API to enumerate the list of available users. </p>",
    "AssociateOpportunity": "<p> Enables you to create a formal association between an <code>Opportunity</code> and various related entities, enriching the context and details of the opportunity for better collaboration and decision making. You can associate an opportunity with the following entity types: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Partner Solution: A software product or consulting practice created and delivered by Partners. Partner Solutions help customers address business challenges using Amazon Web Services services. </p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon Web Services Products: Amazon Web Services offers many products and services that provide scalable, reliable, and cost-effective infrastructure solutions. For the latest list of Amazon Web Services products, see <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/partner-crm-integration-samples/blob/main/resources/aws_products.json\">Amazon Web Services products</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon Web Services Marketplace private offer: Allows Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers to extend custom pricing and terms to individual Amazon Web Services customers. Sellers can negotiate custom prices, payment schedules, and end user license terms through private offers, enabling Amazon Web Services customers to acquire software solutions tailored to their specific needs. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-private-offers.html\">Private offers in Amazon Web Services Marketplace</a>. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To obtain identifiers for these entities, use the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Solution: Use the <code>ListSolutions</code> operation.</p> </li> <li> <p> AWS Products: For the latest list of Amazon Web Services products, see <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/partner-crm-integration-samples/blob/main/resources/aws_products.json\">Amazon Web Services products</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> Amazon Web Services Marketplace private offer: Use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/catalog-apis.html\">Using the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Catalog API</a> to list entities. Specifically, use the <code>ListEntities</code> operation to retrieve a list of private offers. The request returns the details of available private offers. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_ListEntities.html\">ListEntities</a>. </p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateOpportunity": "<p> Creates an <code>Opportunity</code> record in Partner Central. Use this operation to create a potential business opportunity for submission to Amazon Web Services. Creating an opportunity sets <code>Lifecycle.ReviewStatus</code> to <code>Pending Submission</code>. </p> <p> To submit an opportunity, follow these steps: </p> <ol> <li> <p>To create the opportunity, use <code>CreateOpportunity</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To associate a solution with the opportunity, use <code>AssociateOpportunity</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To submit the opportunity, use <code>StartEngagementFromOpportunityTask</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p> After submission, you can't edit the opportunity until the review is complete. But opportunities in the <code>Pending Submission</code> state must have complete details. You can update the opportunity while it's in the <code>Pending Submission</code> state. </p> <p> There's a set of mandatory fields to create opportunities, but consider providing optional fields to enrich the opportunity record. </p>",
    "DisassociateOpportunity": "<p> Allows you to remove an existing association between an <code>Opportunity</code> and related entities, such as a Partner Solution, Amazon Web Services product, or an Amazon Web Services Marketplace offer. This operation is the counterpart to <code>AssociateOpportunity</code>, and it provides flexibility to manage associations as business needs change. </p> <p> Use this operation to update the associations of an <code>Opportunity</code> due to changes in the related entities, or if an association was made in error. Ensuring accurate associations helps maintain clarity and accuracy to track and manage business opportunities. When you replace an entity, first attach the new entity and then disassociate the one to be removed, especially if it's the last remaining entity that's required. </p>",
    "GetAwsOpportunitySummary": "<p> Retrieves a summary of an AWS Opportunity. This summary includes high-level details about the opportunity sourced from AWS, such as lifecycle information, customer details, and involvement type. It is useful for tracking updates on the AWS opportunity corresponding to an opportunity in the partner's account. </p>",
    "GetEngagementInvitation": "<p>Retrieves the details of an engagement invitation shared by AWS with a partner. The information includes aspects such as customer, project details, and lifecycle information. To connect an engagement invitation with an opportunity, match the invitation’s <code>Payload.Project.Title</code> with opportunity <code>Project.Title</code>.</p>",
    "GetOpportunity": "<p> Fetches the <code>Opportunity</code> record from Partner Central by a given <code>Identifier</code>. </p> <p> Use the <code>ListOpportunities</code> action or the event notification (from Amazon EventBridge) to obtain this identifier. </p>",
    "ListEngagementInvitations": "<p>Retrieves a list of engagement invitations sent to the partner. This allows partners to view all pending or past engagement invitations, helping them track opportunities shared by AWS.</p>",
    "ListOpportunities": "<p>This request accepts a list of filters that retrieve opportunity subsets as well as sort options. This feature is available to partners from <a href=\"https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/\">Partner Central</a> using the <code>ListOpportunities</code> API action. </p> <p>To synchronize your system with Amazon Web Services, only list the opportunities that were newly created or updated. We recommend you rely on events emitted by the service into your Amazon Web Services account’s Amazon EventBridge default event bus, you can also use the <code>ListOpportunities</code> action. </p> <p>We recommend the following approach:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Find the latest <code>LastModifiedDate</code> that you stored, and only use the values that came from Amazon Web Services. Don’t use values generated by your system. </p> </li> <li> <p>When you send a <code>ListOpportunities</code> request, submit the date in ISO 8601 format in the <code>AfterLastModifiedDate</code> filter. </p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Web Services only returns opportunities created or updated on or after that date and time. Use <code>NextToken</code> to iterate over all pages. </p> </li> </ol>",
    "ListSolutions": "<p> Retrieves a list of Partner Solutions that the partner registered on Partner Central. This API is used to generate a list of solutions that an end user selects from for association with an opportunity. </p>",
    "RejectEngagementInvitation": "<p>This action rejects an <code>EngagementInvitation</code> that AWS shared. Rejecting an invitation indicates that the partner doesn't want to pursue the opportunity, and all related data will become inaccessible thereafter.</p>",
    "StartEngagementByAcceptingInvitationTask": "<p>This action starts the engagement by accepting an <code>EngagementInvitation</code>. The task is asynchronous and involves the following steps: accepting the invitation, creating an opportunity in the partner’s account from the AWS opportunity, and copying details for tracking. When completed, an <code>Opportunity Created</code> event is generated, indicating that the opportunity has been successfully created in the partner's account.</p>",
    "StartEngagementFromOpportunityTask": "<p>This action initiates the engagement process from an existing opportunity by accepting the engagement invitation and creating a corresponding opportunity in the partner’s system. Similar to <code>StartEngagementByAcceptingInvitationTask</code>, this action is asynchronous and performs multiple steps before completion.</p>",
    "UpdateOpportunity": "<p> Updates the <code>Opportunity</code> record identified by a given <code>Identifier</code>. This operation allows you to modify the details of an existing opportunity to reflect the latest information and progress. Use this action to keep the opportunity record up-to-date and accurate. </p> <p> When you perform updates, include the entire payload with each request. If any field is omitted, the API assumes that the field is set to <code>null</code>. The best practice is to always perform a <code>GetOpportunity</code> to retrieve the latest values, then send the complete payload with the updated values to be changed. </p>"
