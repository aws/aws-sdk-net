A resource group is a collection of resources that match the resource\n      types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can create a\n      group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages,\n      regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource groups enable you to automate\n      management tasks, such as those in AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related\n      resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a\n      custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring\n      data about member resources.</p>\n         <p>To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify\n      the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are key-value pairs.</p>\n         <p>For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS Resource Groups User\n        Guide</a>.</p>\n         <p>AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of operations.</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and resource query entities</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as search results</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Getting data about resources that are members of a group</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>Searching AWS resources based on a resource query</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n      ",

If you \n       specify more than one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has a tag key value that matches <i>any</i> of the specified values.</p>\n         <p>For example, consider the following sample query for resources that have two tags, <code>Stage</code> and <code>Version</code>, with two values each. \n       (<code>[{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Test\",\"Deploy\"]},{\"Key\":\"Version\",\"Values\":[\"1\",\"2\"]}]</code>) The results of this query might include the following.</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>An EC2 instance that has the following two tags: <code>{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Deploy\"]}</code>, and <code>{\"Key\":\"Version\",\"Values\":[\"2\"]}</code>\n               </p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>An S3 bucket that has the following two tags: {\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Test\",\"Deploy\"]}, and {\"Key\":\"Version\",\"Values\":[\"1\"]}</p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>The query would not return the following results, however. The following EC2 instance does not have all tag keys specified in the filter, so it is rejected. \n       The RDS database has all of the tag keys, but no values that match at least one of the specified tag key values in the filter.</p>\n         <ul>\n            <li>\n               <p>An EC2 instance that has only the following tag: <code>{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Deploy\"]}</code>.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n               <p>An RDS database that has the following two tags: <code>{\"Key\":\"Stage\",\"Values\":[\"Archived\"]}</code>, and <code>{\"Key\":\"Version\",\"Values\":[\"4\"]}</code>\n               </p>\n            </li>\n         </ul>\n         <p>\n            <i>\n               <code>CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:</code>\n            </i> A JSON syntax that lets you specify a CloudFormation stack ARN.</p>\n      ",
