        "BREAKING CHANGE: A security fix has been applied to the Transfer Utility Download Directory command which now checks if the directory is case-sensitive before proceeding with the download. This prevents potential overwriting of files in case-insensitive file systems. If you would like to revert to the previous behavior, you can set the 'SkipDirectoryCaseSensitivityCheck' property on the 'TransferUtilityConfig' to true."
