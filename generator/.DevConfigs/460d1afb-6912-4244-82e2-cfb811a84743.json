        "Updated DateTime handling to use UTC instead of local times.",
        "DateTime handling (Breaking Change): Removed obsolete properties such EndTime then changed EndTimeUtc to EndTime. This could lead to offset times for developers still using the marked obsolete original EndTime for example. A compile time error will occur for anyone using any of the removed *Utc properties such as EndTimeUtc.",
        "DateTime handling (Breaking Change): Response unmarshallers for TimeStamps and list TimeStamps for formats TimestampFormat.ISO8601 || TimestampFormat.RFC822 datetimes were being parsed into local times. Adjusted DateTime parsing to return UTC times.",
        "DateTime handling (Breaking Change): Fixed the DateTimeUnmarshaller which was parsing datetime strings into and returning them as local time which in some cases were still getting converted back to UTC on a prior bug fix but not always. DateTime strings unmarshalled are assumed to be UTC time and will be specified and unmarshalled as UTC.",
        "DateTime handling (Breaking Change): ConvertFromUnixEpochSeconds/ConvertFromUnixEpochMilliseconds incorrectly returning the Unix Epoch time as local time instead of a UTC time by definition. This changes the behavior where these methods were used.",
        "DateTime handling (Breaking Change): DynamoDB RetrieveDateTimeInUtc has been switched to true as the default.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): Fixed internal Epoch dates to UTC per definition where the epoch date was created in local time. ",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): Stopped using expiry times in credentials internally as local time. Changed to UTC.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): Ensured DateTime.Max and DateTime.Min are marked with a DateTime.Kind DateTimeKind.Utc for proper calculations.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): Instead of assuming SAML credentials are local time then converting to UTC and assume that the time given is UTC to work properly with credential expiration being in UTC time for other credential providers.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): Console logger outputs timestamps as a UTC date incase output is sent off the local machine and for easier comparison with other UTC dates.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): RetryPolicies return UTC server time instead of a UTC time converted to local time.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): AWSPublicIpAddressRanges mixing UTC and local time.",
        "DateTime handling (Bug fix): GetFormattedTimestampISO8601 incorrectly creating a DateTime object as local time even though it is passed in as UTC. Then formatting it as a UTC string."
