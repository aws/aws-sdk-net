# AWS SDK for .NET API Reference

Welcome to the AWS SDK for .NET API Reference documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the AWS SDK for .NET version 4, including detailed API references for all AWS services supported by the SDK.

## Overview

The AWS SDK for .NET makes it easier for developers to build .NET applications that tap into the cost-effective, scalable, and reliable AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

The AWS SDK for .NET supports development on:
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
- .NET Core 2.0 or later
- Any platform that supports .NET Standard 2.0 or later

As of version 4.0, the AWS SDK for .NET no longer supports .NET Framework 3.5 or 4.5.
