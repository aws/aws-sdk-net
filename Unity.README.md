## Supported Platforms

The AWS SDK for .NET (Unity) is currently only supported on Android, iOS and on Standalone platforms.

## Unity SDK Fundamentals

There are only a few fundamentals that are helpful to know when developing against the AWS SDK for .NET on Unity

* To enable logging you need to create a config file called awsconfig.xml in a `Resources` directory add add the following

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
		<aws 
			<logging
	    		logTo="UnityLogger"
	    		logResponses="Always"
	    		logMetrics="true"
	    		logMetricsFormat="JSON" />
			/>
		/>
	
You can also do this configuration in a script

		var loggingConfig = AWSConfigs.LoggingConfig;
		loggingConfig.LogTo = LoggingOptions.UnityLogger;
		loggingConfig.LogMetrics = true;
		loggingConfig.LogResponses = ResponseLoggingOption.Always;
		loggingConfig.LogResponsesSizeLimit = 4096;
		loggingConfig.LogMetricsFormat = LogMetricsFormatOption.JSON;


* To Build the SDK from the `AWSSDK.Unity.sln` solution file you will need Unity 5 installed in the standard location (we reference the UnityEngine runtime from standard installation location)
* The SDK uses reflection for platform specific components. In case of IL2CPP since `strip bytecode` is always enabled on iOS you need to have a `link.xml` in your assembly root with the following entries


		<linker>
