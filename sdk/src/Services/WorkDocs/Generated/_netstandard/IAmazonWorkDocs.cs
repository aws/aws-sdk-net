    /// <para>
    /// Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional
    /// security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along
    /// with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs.
    /// Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file.
