    /// This operation can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during
    /// every card transaction, and there is a need to avoid importing short-lived keys into
    /// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. It translates short-lived transaction keys
    /// such as Pin Encryption Key (PEK) generated for each transaction and wrapped with an
    /// ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) derived wrapping key to another KEK (Key Encryption
    /// Key) wrapping key.

    /// Before using this operation, you must first request the public key certificate of

    /// pair, public certificate of receiving ECC key pair, and the key derivation parameters
    /// to generate a derived key. The service uses this derived key to unwrap the incoming
    /// transaction key received as a TR31WrappedKeyBlock and re-wrap using a user provided
    /// KEK to generate an outgoing Tr31WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on establishing
