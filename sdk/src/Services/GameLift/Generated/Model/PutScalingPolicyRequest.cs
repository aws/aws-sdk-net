    /// Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity
    /// when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based
    /// and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet
    /// scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need
