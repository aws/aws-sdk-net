    /// recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations.</para> <para>Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount,
    /// your data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable. If your application requires fast or frequent access to
    /// your data, consider using Amazon S3. For more information, go to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).</para> <para>You can store any
