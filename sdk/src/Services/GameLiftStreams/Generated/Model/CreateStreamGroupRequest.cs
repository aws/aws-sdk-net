    /// A stream group is a collection of resources that Amazon GameLift Streams uses to stream
    /// your application to end-users. When you create a stream group, you specify an application
    /// to stream by default and the type of hardware to use, such as the graphical processing
    /// unit (GPU). You can also link additional applications, which allows you to stream
    /// those applications using this stream group. Depending on your expected users, you
    /// also scale the number of concurrent streams you want to support at one time, and in
    /// what locations. 
    /// 
    ///

    /// a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. There are two types

    /// a stream group or adding a location.
