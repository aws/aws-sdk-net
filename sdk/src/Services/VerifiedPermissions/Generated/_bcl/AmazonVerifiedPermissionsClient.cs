    /// Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management service from Amazon Web Services.
    /// You can use Verified Permissions to manage permissions for your application, and authorize
    /// user access based on those permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers
    /// can grant access based on information about the users, resources, and requested actions.
    /// You can also evaluate additional information like group membership, attributes of
    /// the resources, and session context, such as time of request and IP addresses. Verified
    /// Permissions manages these permissions by letting you create and store authorization
    /// policies for your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise business
    /// systems.
    /// 
    ///  
    /// <para>
    /// Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy language to express your permission
    /// requirements. Cedar supports both role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based
    /// access control (ABAC) authorization models.
    /// </para>

    /// When you write Cedar policies that reference principals, resources and actions, you
    /// can define the unique identifiers used for each of those elements. We strongly recommend

    ///  
    /// <para>
    /// For example, if user <c>jane</c> leaves the company, and you later let someone else
    /// use the name <c>jane</c>, then that new user automatically gets access to everything
    /// granted by policies that still reference <c>User::"jane"</c>. Cedar can’t distinguish
    /// between the new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource identifiers.
    /// Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never reused to ensure that
    /// you don’t unintentionally grant access because of the presence of an old identifier
    /// in a policy.
    /// </para>
    ///  
    /// <para>
    /// Where you use a UUID for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment
    /// specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your policies
    /// easier to understand. For example: principal == User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111",
    /// // alice
