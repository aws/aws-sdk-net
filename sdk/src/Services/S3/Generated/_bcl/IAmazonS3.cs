The source and destination buckets must have the same parent Amazon Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP <c>400 Bad Request</c> error with the error code <c>InvalidRequest</c>. </note>  <b>Access points</b> - When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form <i>AccessPointName</i>-<i>AccountId</i>.s3-accesspoint.<i>Region</i>.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name.

You can only copy objects within the same Outpost bucket. It's not supported to copy objects across different Amazon Web Services Outposts, between buckets on the same Outposts, or between Outposts buckets and any other bucket types.
