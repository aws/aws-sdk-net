AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global customers. Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to direct internet traffic from your users to your applications running in AWS Regions. Global Accelerator creates a fixed entry point for your applications through static anycast IP addresses, and routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance, application health and routing policies that you can configure. Global Accelerator supports the following features at launch: static anycast IP addresses, support for TCP and UDP, support for Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers and Elastic-IP address endpoints,  continuous health checking, instant regional failover, fault isolating Network Zones, granular traffic controls, and client affinity.")]
