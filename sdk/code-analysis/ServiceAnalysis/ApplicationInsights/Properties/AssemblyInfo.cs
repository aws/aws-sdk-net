CloudWatch Application Insights detects errors and exceptions from logs, including .NET custom application logs, SQL Server logs, IIS logs, and more, and uses a combination of built-in rules and machine learning, such as dynamic baselining, to identify common problems. You can then easily drill into specific issues with CloudWatch Automatic Dashboards that are dynamically generated. These dashboards contain the most recent alarms, a summary of relevant metrics, and log snippets to help you identify root cause.")]
