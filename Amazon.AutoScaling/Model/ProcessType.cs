    /// process type accepts notifications from Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are associated with the Auto Scaling group. If you suspend the
    /// <c>AlarmNotifications</c> process type, Auto Scaling will not automatically execute scaling policies that would be triggered by alarms.

    /// <c>Terminate</c> ,
    /// alarm notifications are often used to signal that a change in the size of the Auto Scaling group is warranted. If you suspend
    /// <c>Launch</c> or <c>Terminate</c> , Auto Scaling might not be able to implement the alarm's associated policy. </para> <para> The
    /// <c>AZRebalance</c> process type seeks to maintain a balanced number of instances across Availability Zones within a Region. If you remove an
    /// Availability Zone from your Auto Scaling group or an Availability Zone otherwise becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new
    /// instances in an unaffected Availability Zone before terminating the unhealthy or unavailable instances. When the unhealthy Availability Zone
    /// returns to a healthy state, Auto Scaling automatically redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the designated
    /// Availability Zones. </para> <para><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you call SuspendProcesses on the launch process type, the AZRebalance process will
    /// neither launch new instances nor terminate existing instances. This is because the AZRebalance process terminates existing instances only
    /// after launching the replacement instances. If you call SuspendProcesses on the terminate process type, the AZRebalance process can cause
    /// your Auto Scaling group to grow up to ten percent larger than the maximum size. This is because Auto Scaling allows groups to temporarily
    /// grow larger than the maximum size during rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot terminate instances, your Auto Scaling group could
    /// remain up to ten percent larger than the maximum size until you resume the terminate process type. </para> <para> The <c>HealthCheck</c>
    /// process type checks the health of the instances. Auto Scaling marks an instance as unhealthy if Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing informs
    /// Auto Scaling that the instance is unhealthy. The <c>HealthCheck</c> process can override the health status of an instance that you set with
    /// SetInstanceHealth. </para> <para> The <c>ReplaceUnhealthy</c> process type terminates instances that are marked as unhealthy and
    /// subsequently creates new instances to replace them. This process calls both of the primary process types--first <c>Terminate</c> and then
    /// <c>Launch</c> .
    /// </para> <para><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The HealthCheck process type works in conjunction with the ReplaceUnhealthly process type to provide
