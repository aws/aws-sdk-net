    /// time (inactive means that there's no VPN connection in use with the customer
    /// gateway).

    /// You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer
    /// gateway's external interface. The IP address must be static and can't be
    /// behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).

    /// For deviceï¿½s that use Border Gateway Protocal (BGP), you can also provide the 
    /// device's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can 
    /// use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If you don't have an ASN already,
