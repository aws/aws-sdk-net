    /// applications, libraries, etc. Think of this as zipping up the contents
    /// of your hard drive. We provide all the necessary tools to create and

    /// 2. Upload this AMI to the Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple
    /// Storage Service) service. This gives us reliable,
    /// secure access to your AMI.
    /// 3. Register your AMI with Amazon EC2. This allows us to verify
    /// that your AMI has been uploaded correctly and to allocate a unique
    /// identifier for it.
