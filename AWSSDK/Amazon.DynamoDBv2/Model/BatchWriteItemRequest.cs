    /// failed operations are returned in the <i>UnprocessedItems</i> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests.
    /// Typically, you would call <i>BatchWriteItem</i> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new
    /// <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.</para> <para>To write one item, you can use

    /// Amazon DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not behave in the same way as
    /// individual <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> calls would For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete
    /// requests, and <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not return deleted items in the response.</para> <para>If you use a programming language that
    /// supports concurrency, such as Java, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to
    /// manage the threads.</para> <para>With languages that don't support threading, such as PHP, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> will write or delete the
    /// specified items one at a time. In both situations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> provides an alternative where the API performs the specified put
    /// and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your
    /// application.</para> <para>Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write
    /// capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.</para>
