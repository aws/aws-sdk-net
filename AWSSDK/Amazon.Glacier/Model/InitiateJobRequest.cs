    /// Container for the parameters to the InitiateJob operation.
    /// <para>This operation initiates a job of the specified type. In this release, you can initiate a job to retrieve either an archive or a vault
    /// inventory (a list of archives in a vault). </para> <para>Retrieving data from Amazon Glacier is a two-step process: </para> <ol> <li>
    /// <para>Initiate a retrieval job.</para> </li>
    /// <li> <para>After the job completes, download the bytes.</para> </li>
    /// </ol> <para>The retrieval request is executed asynchronously. When you initiate a retrieval job, Amazon Glacier creates a job and returns a
    /// job ID in the response. When Amazon Glacier completes the job, you can get the job output (archive or inventory data). For information about
    /// getting job output, see GetJobOutput operation. </para> <para>The job must complete before you can get its output. To determine when a job
    /// is complete, you have the following options:</para>
    /// <ul>
    /// <li> <para> <b>Use Amazon SNS Notification</b> You can specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon
    /// Glacier can post a notification after the job is completed. You can specify an SNS topic per job request. The notification is sent only
    /// after Amazon Glacier completes the job. In addition to specifying an SNS topic per job request, you can configure vault notifications for a
    /// vault so that job notifications are always sent. For more information, see SetVaultNotifications.</para> </li>
    /// <li> <para> <b>Get job details</b> You can make a DescribeJob request to obtain job status information while a job is in progress. However,
    /// it is more efficient to use an Amazon SNS notification to determine when a job is complete.</para> </li>
    /// 
    /// </ul>
    /// <para><b>NOTE:</b> The information you get via notification is same that you get by calling DescribeJob. </para> <para>If for a specific
    /// event, you add both the notification configuration on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in your initiate job request, Amazon Glacier
    /// sends both notifications. For more information, see SetVaultNotifications.</para> <para>An AWS account has full permission to perform all
    /// operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them
    /// explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management
    /// (IAM).</para> <para> <b>About the Vault Inventory</b> </para> <para>Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every
    /// 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for the vault. The inventory data you get
    /// might be up to a day or two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some time to complete before you can download the vault
    /// inventory. So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find the vault
    /// inventory useful. For example, when you upload an archive, you can provide an archive description but not an archive name. Amazon Glacier
    /// provides you a unique archive ID, an opaque string of characters. So, you might maintain your own database that maps archive names to their
    /// corresponding Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the vault inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile information
    /// in your database with the actual vault inventory. </para> <para> <b>About Ranged Archive Retrieval</b> </para> <para> You can initiate an
    /// archive retrieval for the whole archive or a range of the archive. In the case of ranged archive retrieval, you specify a byte range to
    /// return or the whole archive. The range specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, that is the range start value must be divisible by 1 MB and
    /// range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the end of the archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not megabyte aligned,
    /// this operation returns a 400 response. Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you download using Get Job Output API, the
    /// range must be tree hash aligned. </para> <para>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity
    /// and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific
    /// actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).</para> <para>For conceptual information
