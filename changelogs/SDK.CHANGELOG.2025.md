	* DateTime handling (Bug fix): Fixed internal Epoch dates to UTC per definition where the epoch date was created in local time. 
	* DateTime handling (Bug fix): GetFormattedTimestampISO8601 incorrectly creating a DateTime object as local time even though it is passed in as UTC. Then formatting it as a UTC string.
	* DateTime handling (Bug fix): Instead of assuming SAML credentials are local time then converting to UTC and assume that the time given is UTC to work properly with credential expiration being in UTC time for other credential providers.
	* DateTime handling (Bug fix): RetryPolicies return UTC server time instead of a UTC time converted to local time.
	* DateTime handling (Bug fix): Stopped using expiry times in credentials internally as local time. Changed to UTC.
	* Fix [#2464](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/2464): Perform background refresh of credentials during preempt expiry period (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/pull/3541)
	* Fix [#3497](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/3497): Make InternalSDKUtils aot compatible in V4

	* This change enhances integrity protections for new SDK requests to S3. S3 SDKs now support the CRC64NVME checksum algorithm, full object checksums for multipart S3 objects, and new default integrity protections for S3 requests.
	* In order to improve [data integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html), the AWS SDKs, including the AWS SDK for .NET, now automatically calculate checksums for all requests and responses that support it (using the `CRC32` algorithm by default). Although not recommended, you may disable the checksum validation by either: setting the `RequestChecksumCalculation` / `ResponseChecksumValidation` options of the `AmazonS3Config` to `WHEN_REQUIRED` (this will instruct the SDK to only calculate checksums when the service requires one) or setting the `DisableDefaultChecksumValidation` flag of the `PutObject` / `UploadPart` / `TransferUtilityUpload` operations to `false` (this will bypass the checksum calculations - meaning data integrity will rely only on SIGV4 payload signing and HTTPS).
	* BREAKING CHANGE: The `CompleteMultipartUploadRequest.AddPartETags` method now only includes ETags returned by `CopyObject` and `UploadPart` operations. This only impacts use cases where multi-part uploads were performed using the low-level APIs and a checksum algorithm was explicitly specified in the `InitiateMultipartUploadRequest`; to include additional checksums (such as `ChecksumCRC32` or `ChecksumSHA256`), use the new `AddPartETagsAndChecksums` method instead.
