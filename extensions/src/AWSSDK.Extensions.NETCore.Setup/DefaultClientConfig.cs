        // 1: For value types like bool, int and TimeSpan use the nullable version
        // 2: For TimeSpan properties users will configure in configuration source, like appsettings.json, using milliseconds
        // 3: In the following locations the list or properties are alphabetical
        // 4: Update GetAWSOptions in ConfigurationExtensions to copy the value from IConfiguration onto DefaultClientConfig
        // 5: Update CreateConfig in ClientFactory to copy the value from DefaultClientConfig to the actual service specific ClientConfig
        // 6: Update the Schema/ConfigurationSchema.json with the new property for appsettings.json intellisense
